title: Review of EasyEngine 4
next: first-page
---

If you're reading this, you're probably looking for a reason to choose EasyEngine 4 and dive deeper into it. Here are the reasons why I currently use EasyEngine 4 for my important websites.  

First, I should clarify that I'm neither a developer nor a professional system administrator. I've been managing my company's websites for 20 years, giving me long-term experience in technology changes and the challenges that arise over time. This is a serious job because these websites sustain my business.  

This review is based more on experience than professional testing, with deep respect for all contributions within the open-source community.  

## What Does EasyEngine Do?

Like other LEMP stack server management tools, here are its six most important functions:  

1. Set up a web server with LEMP stack components based on Docker/containers.  
2. Automatically create WordPress websites with complete configuration, connection, and optimization.  
3. Install, manage, and renew SSL certificates automatically.  
4. Easily manage the website lifecycle: clone, sync, upgrade, edit, and delete.  
5. Support full-page caching and object caching with Redis.  
6. Provide optional admin tools: phpMyAdmin, MailHog, Redis web viewer, etc.

## EasyEngine 4's Performance with Docker is Surprising

Your first concern is likely the performance of EasyEngine 4. Before reading my notes, you‚Äôve probably come across numerous ‚Äúwarnings‚Äù about Docker's performance‚Äîsince EasyEngine is based on it, you might expect performance sacrifices.  

When the development team decided to adopt Docker, they acknowledged a slight performance trade-off. However, in my experience, its performance is actually excellent‚Äîfar exceeding my expectations. This even surprised the developers themselves when they completed EasyEngine 4 after two years. I can confirm this firsthand.  

## Comparison: EasyEngine vs. Centminmod, WordOps

I don‚Äôt have rigorous benchmark tests, but I have used various server management solutions, including OpenLiteSpeed, Centminmod, WordOps (a fork of EasyEngine 3), SlickStack, and a few others I didn't spend much time on. Here‚Äôs my assessment:  

### 1. [OpenLiteSpeed](https://openlitespeed.org/)
It has very fast response times, and that‚Äôs undeniable. It has been praised extensively, to the point where I prioritized trying it. However, when I switched to Nginx, I realized those praises didn‚Äôt necessarily translate into better overall performance. You can achieve a faster Nginx setup than OLS with proper tuning.  

### 2. [Centminmod](https://centminmod.com/) 
Often cited as the fastest LEMP management system‚Äîand that‚Äôs true. It consistently ranks at the top in performance benchmarks. Developed by a single passionate individual, Daniel Lu, Centminmod focuses intensely on performance and security.  

However, this extreme optimization makes it complex. It auto-configures the server, builds customized software, and fine-tunes everything to the limit. This results in a system that is difficult to configure, troubleshoot, and maintain. Although Lu provides free support, it‚Äôs not enough to offset the challenges. I eventually gave up on Centminmod because my website had errors, wasn't as fast as expected, and I had no clear path to fixing it.  

### 3. [WordOps](https://wordops.net/)  
I tried WordOps because I was comfortable with a traditional LEMP setup and hesitant about Docker‚Äôs complexity. WordOps is easy to use and efficient‚Äîvery similar to EasyEngine v3. However, I encountered caching issues, which I expected to "just work" but didn't.  

Even after multiple attempts, I couldn‚Äôt fix it. I also found syntax errors in the pre-configured Nginx settings, which reduced my confidence in the system. This made me understand why EasyEngine abandoned the v3 model and rebuilt everything from scratch with Docker.

### 4. [SlickStack](https://slickstack.io/) 
I didn‚Äôt spend much time on this one. It‚Äôs designed for a narrow use case‚Äîrequiring Cloudflare, supporting only one website per server, and pre-installing many optimization plugins.  

These limitations, along with concerns about plugin maintenance and deep system optimizations, made me uncertain about its approach. Plus, when I compared performance scores with EasyEngine, SlickStack didn‚Äôt hold up. Although they have a unique philosophy, I quickly moved on.  

### 5. EasyEngine 4
In terms of performance, it is one of the few solutions that can compete with Centminmod. While Centminmod generally performs better, the difference isn't drastic. Given Centminmod‚Äôs operational difficulties, I chose EasyEngine.  

In the end, I was able to set up a website faster than I had with Centminmod‚Äîand without errors (except for occasional database log overflow issues).  

At first, I hesitated to use EasyEngine 4 because I assumed running multiple containers would be inferior to a native LEMP stack. However, troubleshooting and updates made me give it a try, accepting a potential performance loss. The result? I got the fastest system I‚Äôve ever had.  

Perhaps there's a reason why the computing world has embraced Docker so much. I‚Äôm even excited that with EasyEngine 4, I‚Äôm not stuck in outdated thinking.  

## How Does Docker Benefit a Web Server System?

Here are the reasons the EasyEngine team gives for using Docker‚Äîmost of which I‚Äôve experienced and agree with:  

1. Handles inconsistencies in base images.  
2. Ensures cross-platform compatibility.  
3. Improves security through process isolation.  
4. Simplifies dependency and process management.  
5. Enhances consistency between development and production environments.  
6. Enables easy scaling and updates.  

At first glance, these seem like developer-centric benefits rather than user advantages. However, they directly impact our experience:  

1. **Better security** ‚Äì Container isolation makes maintenance and security management easier.  
2. **Great performance** ‚Äì Fewer conflicts, better dependency management, and quick updates improve overall performance.  
3. **Ease of use** ‚Äì Consistent production environments and reduced conflicts make customizations and improvements easier to apply.  

And the proof? As I mentioned earlier, I now have a fast, error-free system. The only extra thing I need to do is learn more about Docker! üòä

## Team Mindset and Underrated Potential  

EasyEngine made a big impact when it first launched and was warmly welcomed‚Äîup until version 3. But when they transitioned to v4 with Docker, they gradually lost fans and attention. Not only that, but they also faced significant backlash from the community.  

Since then, you‚Äôll hardly find any reviews about EasyEngine 4 because the warnings erased curiosity and exploration. It‚Äôs also possible that their fanbase simply wasn‚Äôt ready for the change. I can make some educated guesses about the reasons:  

1. Most users who manage their own LEMP stack are either amateurs or independent operators. They are familiar with the traditional LEMP stack and rely on copying and pasting solutions from Google without needing to understand how things work. When Docker was introduced, the fear of the unknown‚Äîamplified by community skepticism‚Äîkept them from even trying it.  
2. Early issues: The initial release might have had some ‚Äúbugs,‚Äù causing systems to stop working entirely when users made the switch. Their work was suddenly disrupted, leading to panic and an urgent need to revert or move to an alternative like WordOps. That experience made them hesitant to try again.  
3. Documentation: With EasyEngine, you can‚Äôt simply copy and paste solutions from the internet anymore. You need to understand things a bit more to customize them for your needs. Combined with the issues mentioned in point #2, this completely killed any willingness to further explore EasyEngine.  

I had to overcome all three of these barriers myself when adopting EasyEngine 4, which is exactly why I wrote the *EasyEngine 4 Notes*. It‚Äôs my way of expressing gratitude to the team behind it.  

By the way, I truly admire the mindset and problem-solving approach of rtCamp‚Äîthe company that created and continues to support EasyEngine. They aren‚Äôt just experts in WordPress, Nginx, and DevOps; they also have strong principles in maintaining a sustainable project with a balanced resource strategy. They‚Äôve nurtured EasyEngine for nearly a decade. I respect their shift from Ops to DevOps, their emphasis on overall performance over local optimizations, and their prioritization of speed and efficiency. Their success and the respect they command in the WordPress Enterprise community are well-earned. Wishing the team endless passion, fulfillment, and plenty of financial rewards for their talent!  

Among all the server management solutions I‚Äôve mentioned, EasyEngine stands out in its business mindset. At this level, its closest competitor is probably *Trellis* by Roots. However, if you only manage a few websites and aren‚Äôt a professional developer, stay away from Trellis.
