title: EasyEngine 4 Notes
next: review
---

I am amazed by the convenience and performance of EasyEngine 4 and find it unfairly underrated despite the team's effort and dedication—simply because it uses Docker, a progressive choice. That is why I am writing these notes, making it easier for those unfamiliar with Docker to deploy and benefit from this excellent community project. In doing so, it may also support the EasyEngine team in continuing this proud journey.

These notes were compiled during my process of selecting, learning, deploying, and troubleshooting EasyEngine 4. I want to make them public with some appropriate edits for others to reference. I believe they will help those on a similar journey find answers much faster, making this experience truly effortless.

If you are learning how to set up your first web server, looking for a better way to manage your existing web server, or have heard about EasyEngine 4 but still have concerns, then these notes are exactly for you.

Don't worry about the warnings about Docker or its complexity. I knew nothing about Docker before using EasyEngine 4. The development team has truly achieved something remarkable: you don’t need any prior knowledge of Docker to operate a Dockerized web server with EasyEngine.
